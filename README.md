Use your computer without a mouse + other fancy smart stuff! 

=== Mouseless Browsing ===
Setting program options and navigating menus without Googling, hunting, and pecking all the time.

=== Smart Suggestions ===
-“Renew all library books”, does the 4 commands you need, maybe in a separate window so you can do other stuff?
-“Why is my playlist not going to the next song?” (one of the repeat modes is turned on). Search through help files and link with menu items automatically.
